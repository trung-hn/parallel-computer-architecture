Steps to compile and run the program:

1. Run the command make to compile the program files

2. Type ./pso followed by the function-name, dimension, swarm-size, xmin, xmax, max-iter, and num-threads

   function-name: name of function to optimiz (booth, holder_table, or egghold)e
   dimension: dimensionality of search
   spaceswarm-size: number of particles in swarm
   xmin, xmax: lower and upper bounds on search domain
   max-iter: number of iterations to run the optimizer
   num-threads: number of threads to create

   Example: ./pso eggholder 2 100 -512 512 1000 1

3. Run make clean to remove executable files in source directory
